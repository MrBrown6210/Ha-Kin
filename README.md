Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

## What I've Learned

- [x] Page
- [x] Component & Prop
- [x] Dynamic Layout
- [x] Tailwind (for NextJS)
- [x] Fetching API and [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [x] [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)
- [x] Authentication
- [x] Guard Routing
- [x] Redux and Redux-toolkit
- [ ] Transition

## Issue

- When you open website for a while you will see error because fetching API from service worker, **reload** the website for fix it.
- Guard routing doing wrong, maybe should use other method.
